# CDH2017
A demo app made for CoderDojo Wiesbaden

**What is this?**
This is a hopefully very simple App to demonstrate children at the Dojo how to use basic functions for Android.

**What can this do?**
Well, for you probably nothing. It just displays a few random sentences and colors. 

**If you still want to test this app on your phone** (although I don't recommend it), [you can download the apk file here](https://github.com/koenidv/CDH2017/releases/download/ONE/app.apk).
